Spectroscopic observations enable studies of the chemical composition of star-forming regions based on their distinct molecular emission and absorption spectra. The difficulty of detecting complex organic molecules, which probe chemical complexity, scales with their size â€” emission from heavy molecules is distributed over many lines, often too weak to detect individually. To address this, MCMC algorithms have been implemented to fit spectral models to sparse radio spectra by efficiently exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces. The results will be included in a forthcoming publication. The code is ready to be adapted for new sources, facilitating future research in molecular detection through multi-transition radio observations.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed on your machine before proceeding with the setup.

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KahaanGandhi/Cha1-MCMC.git
cd Cha1-MCMC
```
Create and activate a new Conda environment with the appropriate Python version (3.9):

```bash
conda create --name cha1-mcmc-env python=3.9
conda activate cha1-mcmc-env
```
Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you encounter any issues with specific packages that aren't available, install them manually:
```bash
conda install <package-name>
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use [MacPorts](https://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.macports.html), run the following:
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/KahaanGandhi/Cha1-MCMC.git
cd Cha1-MCMC

# Install Python 3.9 using MacPorts
sudo port install python39
sudo port select --set python python39

# Install pip for Python 3.9
sudo port install py39-pip

# Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file
pip-3.9 install -r requirements.txt
```

Again, if you encounter any issues with specific packages, install them manually:
```bash
sudo port install <package-name>
```

## Running Instructions

### Step 1: Preparing the Data

- Verify your data is in the correct `.npy` format, containing frequency and intensity arrays for the molecule of interest. Refer to `DSN_pipeline.ipynb`  for guidance on reformatting common file formats.
- Add your data to the `data_paths` section of the configuration in `MCMC_inference.py`, following the format:
```python
'molecule_name': os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'your_data_folder', 'your_data_file.npy'),
```

### Step 2: Configuring the MCMC Run

- Open the `MCMC_inference.py` file and locate the `config` dictionary at the bottom of the script.
- Adjust parameters like `dish_size`, `lower_limit`, and `upper_limit` to match your telescope and observations. The configuration is currently set up for DSS-43 observations of Chamaeleon I, and should be adjusted accordingly for different telescopes or sources. Verify that your molecule of interest has rotational transitions that fall within the specified frequency range.

- You can also increase `nwalkers` or `nruns` to explore more of the parameter space during MCMC sampling.

### Step 3: Running the Initial MCMC

- For your initial run, set ```template_run``` to ```True``` to use hardcoded initial values specific to the template species.
- Cyanopolyynes like HC<sub>5</sub>N tend to share source properties, so it is recommended to first obtain a fit for shorter linear molecules, as their transitions are more easily detectable above noise levels.
- Run the script from the main directory:
```bash
cd /path/to/Cha1-MCMC
python MCMC_inference.py
```

For MacPorts users, remember to explictly call the correct Python version when running scripts:
```bash
python3.9 MCMC_inference.py
```

### Step 4: Refining the Fit

- After the initial run, set `template_run` to `False` to load priors from the previous run into the analysis.
- You can rerun the script to refine the fit:
```bash
python MCMC_inference.py
```
- If desired, you can redo the template run (perhaps with more walkers or steps for a more thorough exploration of the parameter space), which will overwrite the previous template run results.
